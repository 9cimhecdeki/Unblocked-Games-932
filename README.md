# Unblocked Games 932
 
 
It sounds like you have been unable to send messages to a specific contact after recently blocking and then unblocking each others phone numbers. I can certainly understand why this would be a problem, and I'm happy to help you resolve it.

What happens when you try to send a message to that contact? When you send a message to a contact you have blocked through your iPhone, it would not show "Delivered" under the message, and the recipient wouldn't receive it. Are you seeing "Delivered" under the messages you're attempting to send? If so, this may be an issue with the other person's device. If they are using an iPhone too, make sure they have correctly unblocked you using the steps here: Block phone numbers, contacts, and emails on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. Keep in mind, if they blocked your number directly through their carrier, unblocking your number using the steps in that support article would not be sufficient in allowing you to send messages to them. They would need to contact their carrier to remove the block.
 
If something else is occurring when you send messages to them, i.e., you're seeing a red exclamation mark with the words "Not Delivered", take a look at this support article: If you can't send or receive messages on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. Try out any troubleshooting steps there you haven't already completed.
 
I have a nighthawk 7000 router, I am using Genie with Access control turned on. I sucessfully block some devices from accesing the network. Somehow the Devices get un blocked with out me doing it. I use this to block my kids phones and or computer. This is done by device and child. How can I ensure that once a device gets blocked, it stays blocked until I unblock it.
 
Make sure that they do not have access to the router's admin page. You can do that by setting your own router password other than the default password. Also, if they have access to the device that you are using to manage the access control, make sure that you logout of it on the NETGEAR Genie program or app.
 
I am pretty sure they do not have access. This also happens on my sons Chromecast. The chromecast gets unblocked almost imeadiatly, faster than he could even log on if he was even able to. I never use the default password, this is the first thing I change. I would also change the user name from admin but it doesn't allow it. I can change the password again for a test to see what happens. I highy doubt they have access. I run genie on my phone, my PC and my wifes phone. I'll try doing some test to see I can replicate the problem. Is it possible that resetting the wifi connection would do this?

Aircraft are not unblocked when sold. If the owner would like us to unblock the aircraft immediately, they can fax us a letter requesting that their aircraft be unblocked along with proof of ownership (aircraft registration and additional supporting documents if necessary to link the name of the requester with the name listed on the registration). This will only unblock the aircraft on FlightAware; to unblock the aircraft with all ASDI vendors, the owner needs to fill out the NBAA BARR unblock form, which will take effect within about a month.
 
Requests for adding/dropping aircraft from the list will be taken at any time, however the block will not go into effect immediately. The block database at the FAA source at the VOLPE Center will be updated quarterly. Aircraft operators considering the FAA level block should first check with their flight tracking vendor to discuss the impact that this option will have on their ability to monitor flights. The block database will be submitted to ASDI vendors monthly. The following chart reflects cut off dates and action dates for the adding/dropping from the block list.

We are using Agile Two Week Sprints cycles. Sometimes we take on JIRA stories which are blocked, and will not be unblocked until the middle 1 week into of the sprint. Another person's code is complete, and I can finally begin my coding part. Is this an acceptable practice? Sometimes I worry that, I will not complete the JIRA story in time, if time to code, develop, test, deploy is cut in half.
 
I think Thomas Owen's answer is a great overall fit, but there's an additional implicit assumption in your question that should be frame-challenged. In any framework, agile or not, work often has dependencies. You're describing a finish-to-start dependency where you can't begin a piece of work until the work product it depends on is completed. Dependencies are sometimes unavoidable, but if you are regularly planning work that is highly interdependent and lacks sufficient slack to be completed reliably then you have a process problem.
 
While not required by the Scrum framework, the INVEST mnemonic is widely considered a best practice, and it sounds like you're routinely planning items that are not independent, and may not be small enough to be estimable with high confidence when started so late in the Sprint.
 
"Vertical slicing" of backlog items is also a common best practice. Rather than passing work along a conveyer-belt style production line, Scrum practices that advocate a more holistic whole team approach where the Developers collaborate on shepherding an Increment through the process is generally preferable. You may hear this referred to as "swarming," "pairing," "mob programming," or other terms depending on your given product domain, but it all starts with understanding that a completed Increment is something the whole team is collectively focused on delivering, rather than relying on input/output queues between Developer workstations.
 
Since you didn't provide any specifics about your work items, consider this example. Rather than having one developer work on a back-end model data before another developer starts work on the front-end user interface, imagine a user story that says:
 
This is a great vertical slice because it requires work on multiple layers of a web application, and ideally can be a collaborate task that involves design and testing of the database, model, controller, and view all at once. Instead of a stove-piped process, members of the team can:
 
If the whole Scrum Team is following the requirements of the Scrum Guide, then the entire team has committed to a singular Sprint Goal rather than to doing a random collection of individual work items. The Scrum Guide section on the Sprint Backlog specifically says:
 
The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it. The Sprint Goal also creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.
 
Note the emphasis on a single, focused objective. Scrum doesn't promote individual Developers working on unrelated or sequential tasks in parallel; it actually requires them to collectively commit to delivering a coherent Increment of value: the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal in turn creates progress towards a Product Goal. If you aren't planning your work around a focused goal, and then layering on tightly-coupled dependencies that can't be delivered independently, then you are actively creating the pull-queue problem you're describing in your original question.
 
Don't do that. Instead, work on planning your work around Sprint Goals and collective delivery of each Increment. These changes should reduce cycle delays, increase the success rate of goal-oriented deliveries, and decrease the risk of incomplete work due to unforeseen delays or queuing issues.
 
In Scrum, a Sprint is not about completing work. The primary purpose of a Sprint is to achieve a valuable goal. Some work is needed to complete the goal. However, we want to acknowledge that at any point in time, the work is only a guess as to what will be needed to accomplish the goal. By doing the work, additional needed work may emerge, and some work may become unnecessary.
